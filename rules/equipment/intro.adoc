Gear is very important for all sorts of tasks. Generally, it can be sorted into a few categories: armor (for keeping you alive), weaponry (for making others not-alive), consumables (things you use only once), general equipment (things to wear that aren't armor), and general gear (things that are useful and don't fit elsewhere).
