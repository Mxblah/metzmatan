=== Rounding and Fifth Values

Many systems in this game require division and may produce decimal numbers. Always round down when dealing with decimals, unless otherwise instructed.

Many character attributes or skills are divided by 5 (known as a "fifth value") in various circumstances, often when applying the value as a bonus to some other value. This is notated as `<value>/5`.
